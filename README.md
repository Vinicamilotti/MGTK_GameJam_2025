> The theme for GMTK Game Jam 2025 is "Loop"
How you interpret this theme is entirely up to you.
Perhaps it's about doing the exact same thing over and over again. Perhaps it's about racetracks, or programming instructions, or loop the loops.
You'll get a chance to explain how your game fits the theme when you submit it. And you won't be disqualified if the game doesn't adequately fit the theme.
